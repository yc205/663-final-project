      "    \n",
      "    In this paper, the fast FSR variable selection algorithm will be implemented and applied to the NCAA data which is provided by the \"Boos-Stefanski Variable Selection Home\" http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/ncaa.data.orig.txt. I will reivewed two literatures before implementing algorithms in this paper. Then, I will presents simulation results and the results of the real data set. I will try some methods in improving the algorithm efficiency or using the multiple cores for saving the execution time. Furthermore, I will compare the other variable selection method, such as LASSO and stepwise and compare the method in prediction performance. \n",

      "     This paper is published in 2009. There are two other papers should be reviewed before implementing this algorithm. One is the 2004 dissertation of Yujun Wu http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/5883/1/etd.pdf. The other is 2007 paper Wu, Boos, and Stefanski (2007) \"Controlling Variable Selection by the Addition of Pseudovariables,\" Journal of the American Statistical Association, No. 477, p. 235-243.\n",
